# Business Card Project
Welcome to my very first front-end project: a simple yet elegant digital business card. This project marks the beginning of my journey into the world of front-end web development.

## Overview
This business card project was created as a hands-on exercise to learn and practice the basics of HTML and CSS. It is a minimalist, responsive, and visually appealing digital card that showcases essential information in a clean layout.

## Run the project
Head over to the terminal and enter **start index.html**. You can also use Live Server extension.
